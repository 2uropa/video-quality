Video Quality Metrics
=============

Video quality metrics, reference implementation in python, with GPU optimizations and C versions as time permits.

- VIF-P, Visual Information Fidelity: implemented
- SSIM, Structural Similarity Metric: implemented
- PSNR, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio: implemented
- RECO, Relative Polar Edge Coherence: planned
- MS-SSIM, MultiScale Structural Similarity Metric: planned
- 3SSIM, 3-Component Structural Similarity Metric: planned
- VQUAD-HD: planned
- VQM: maybe
- UIQ, Universal Image Quality
- MSSIM, Motion SSIM
